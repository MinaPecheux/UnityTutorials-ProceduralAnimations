# [Unity/C#] Creating procedural animations

**Mina PÃªcheux - November 2022**

Did you know we can actually code up movement in scripts? Thanks to Unity's amazing [`Animation Rigging`](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.animation.rigging@1.2/manual/index.html) package, we can boost our imported rigs with additional controllers like IKs, and then use C# logic to create a simple system of **procedural animation**.

Learn more in the text tutorial [on Medium](https://medium.com/codex/creating-procedural-animations-in-unity-c-8c5c2394739d)!

In this 10 minutes-tutorial, I'm discussing how to setup a Unity rig with IK handles and how to code up a basic autonomous script that moves the feet to follow the body at all time.

This Github repo contains an improved version of the script that is coded in the tutorial with optional smoothing using coroutines, and it also contains all of the assets shown in the demo images and videos :)
